# Common state cycle #

The most common state path is **New**->**Active**->`[`**Open** -> **Active** `]`->**Finalized** . This corresponds to the work unit being added to the system and activated, then work is submitted, then the submission is graded. If the submission is rejected, the work unit becomes **open**. If the submission is approved, the work unit becomes **finalized**.
