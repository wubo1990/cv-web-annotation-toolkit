The project is a collection of tools to annotate images via web. The main goal to allow online annotation of image collections with rich meta data. The tools will be highly-reusable and scalable.

In the near future we aim to:
  * integrate with [Mechanical Turk](http://www.mturk.com)
  * implement [Pascal VOC annotation protocol](http://pascallin.ecs.soton.ac.uk/challenges/VOC/voc2008/)
  * integrate with [ROS](http://pr.willowgarage.com/wiki/ROS)


Take a look at our demos:
  * AnnotationToolDemo shows the basic use of the web interface
  * AnnotationStorageDemo shows the basic use of the annotations storage server.

Contributions are welcome!
